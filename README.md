# 🚮 AI-Based Garbage Classification - Week 1

This project is developed as part of my internship under the AICTE Edunet Foundation. The aim is to build a smart solution using Artificial Intelligence that can classify garbage into categories like paper, plastic, metal, etc., and help in automating waste management.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this task is to develop a deep learning model that can identify different types of waste by analyzing images. This kind of model can be useful in real-life applications such as smart bins, recycling units, and promoting eco-friendly environments.

## 📚 Technologies Used

- *Language*: Python  
- *Libraries*: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Gradio  
- *Model*: Transfer Learning using EfficientNetV2B2  
- *Platform*: Google Colab (GPU enabled)

## 🗃 Dataset Details

The dataset contains six categories of garbage images:
- Cardboard  
- Glass  
- Metal  
- Paper  
- Plastic  
- Trash  

> The dataset is stored on Google Drive due to size limitations and needs to be manually downloaded and mounted in Google Colab.

*Folder Structure:*                                                                                     garbage_classification/
